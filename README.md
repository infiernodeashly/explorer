Title: Easytravel

Description: Frequent travelers to a new city want to know what the city is like. This app would help them figure the city out in term of weather, restaurants, hotels, bars, religious places, and museums. Once the user opens the page of the app, icons/a list of places they want to look for appear (restaurants, hotels, bars, religious places, museums).
After the user clicks on one icon (let’s say they want to look for nearby hotels so they click on the hotel icon), a search bar appears, where the user is allowed to type the city they are visiting/they are in. Once the user types the name of the city (let’s say Boston), results of the nearby hotels appear, using the google Places API. Once the results appear, the weather of this city appears too (using the Open Weather API) on one side of the page beside the name of the city.

User Story:
As a new visitor, I would like to find the weather and restaurants in a specified area, so I can find a good place to eat while planning around the weather."
